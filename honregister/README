a script to automate account creation for hon accounts (heroesofnewerth.com)

it gets really annoying to register every time (it's like 10 clicks or something)
just call register_account() with name as your desired account name, and it makes an account for you.
returns True if it succeeds in creating the account (failure is usually because account name is taken)
throws all kinds of unhandled exceptions if it fails
